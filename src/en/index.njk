    <p>Dear friends and family,</p>
    <p>It’s our great pleasure to welcome you to our wedding website. Here you will find all the information you need to know before our special day. It will be updated with new details like the wedding day agenda, the menu, and more so you can follow us on this exciting journey. After the event, we will share a link where you will find pictures and videos taken by our photographer, and you will have the chance to share the ones you’ll take during that day.</p>
    <p>Feel free to scroll down and start this journey toward our wedding day.</p>

    <h2>Dress code</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to take the chance of our wedding to pick your favourite dress, the one you bought for “special occasions” and never got the opportunity to get out of the wardrobe. We want you to feel the best version of yourself, like a shining star in the night sky. Don’t refrain yourself and be as festive as you can be. We only request from you to wear something blue (Royal blue or similar); it could be just a detail on your outfit, a blazer or even your hair. It’s up to you, be creative, be yourself. Keep in mind that the wedding will be in December and the activities will be indoor.</p>

    <h2>Location & booking</h2>
    <p>Our Wedding will take place on 12th December 2022 at the gorgeous Royal Marine Hotel, just in front of the sea. We will have our wedding ceremony in the Kingstown Suite and the reception in the Martello Suite.</p>
    <address>
        <b>Hotel website:</b> <a href="https://www.royalmarine.ie" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.royalmarine.ie</a>
        <br><b>Address:</b> Marine Road, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin A96 K063, Ireland
    </address>
    <p>Before navigating you through the Irish transport, I may mention that you should not be surprised if the name of a station or a bus stop seems to change. This is because, in Ireland, they use both names: the English and the Gaelic. So each stop has two names. I will mention only the ingress ones below. Another local custom to mention is that they say “thank you” to the bus driver every time they get off the bus. You are encouraged to do the same if you don’t want to be rude. The bus ticket can be purchased on the bus, but they accept only coins and don’t give you the change. Dart’s tickets can be purchased at any station from a machine. You can select your preferred language and pay cash or by card.</p>
    <p><b>How to get to the hotel from the city centre with public transport:</b> Dart at Connolly Station, get off at Dún Laoghaire. The hotel is within walking distance.</p>
    <p><b>How to get to the hotel from the airport by public transport:</b> bus 747 (it takes 17 minutes to get to the city centre, the fee is €7 single ticket, there is a discount if you buy the return ticket at the same time). Or you can take cheaper buses such as 41 & 16 (it takes 45minus to get to the city centre, fee: €3.30). Once you get to the city centre, take the Dart at Connolly Station and get off at Dún Laoghaire. The hotel is within walking distance.</p>
